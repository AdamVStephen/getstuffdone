# Bash Aliases

A number of handy aliases in .alias-<domain> format to pick and choose between from your .bashrc.

## SSH

1. ssshfp : show the MD5 fingerprint for your default SSH key (for comparison with github)

## Cygwin

1. cdw : change directory to the windows %HOMEPATH% as opposed to the cygwin $HOME.
